<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is Haonan Zhang. I hold a master's degree in systems science from the University of Ottawa and a bachelor's
degree in computer science from Carleton University. My strong and fast learning capability has been consistently
demonstrated by my academic performance throughout the years of my studies, as I earned the dean's honor list in 2021
and my average for my graduate study is A- or above although Uottawa doesn't calculate GPA for graduate students.</p>

<p>Uottawa and Carleton equipped me with in-depth technical knowledge and many hands-on practical experiences.
For example, for the backend I designed and built a storage web application with an in-memory cache system for trading with Java, 
for frontend I used Javascript, HTML, and CSS to build a user profile management system and made a scheduler API specifically for cache events. 
Also, I have experience and knowledge in databases, both relational and non-relational, and I have pretty good marks in algorithm-related courses. </p>

<p>Aside from school, I have a work-study as a Software Engineer at Community Dreams Foundation. I collaborated with my coworker
to design, develop, and test an easy-to-understand web page for home assessment using JavaScript, constructed reliable
connections between front-end pages and SQL database, and utilized new test techniques such as unit testing to enhance
testing efficiency and scalability. This work experience enhanced my technical skills and gave me a sense of what Agile
is, and how to work efficiently in a team.</p>
